# OS-Archive
An archive of operating system versions.

## This is an automated collection of operating systems.
In short, this repository contains:
- Most popular linux distros (an effort is underway to get ALL of them)
- All windows versions
- All Windows 10 Versions
- Some original OEM DOS versions

Most versions are collected and uploaded automatically by a bot. However some older operating systems are uploaded automatically.

## Navigating the archive
Operating systems are stored under the following conventions:
<Company>/<Operating System Name>/<Version>/<x64-x86>/Company-OSName-Version-Bit.zip
If the OS is not produced by a corporation and is instead produced as an open source project, the company is ommited. Examples:
- Microsoft/Windows 10/20H2/x64/Microsoft-Windows_10-20H2-x64.zip
- Arch Linux/2020-01-01/x64/ArchLinux-2020_01_021-x64.zip

An operating system can be referenced under the following convention:
<Company>.<Name>.<Version>.<Bitlevel>
Again, omit company if nessecary.
Examples:
- Microsoft.Windows10.20H2.x64
- ArchLinux.2020-01-01.x64

Please note that some older operating systems require a certain OEM motherboard to work. Compaq images are provided in this repository.
